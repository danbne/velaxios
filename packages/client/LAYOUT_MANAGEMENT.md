# Enhanced View Management System

## Overview

The grid has been enhanced with a comprehensive view management system that provides quick access to all view-related functionality. Users can now manage views through both the toolbar dropdown menu and the status bar, making view management much more accessible and user-friendly.

## New Features

### 1. Toolbar View Management Dropdown

- **Location**: Grid toolbar (left side, before action buttons)
- **Functionality**: Dropdown menu with all view management options
- **Features**:
  - **Open View**: Opens a popup list of available views to choose from
  - **Save View**: Saves the current grid state to the current view
  - **Save View As**: Opens a dialog to save current state as a new view
  - **Manage Views**: Opens a management dialog for renaming/deleting views
  - **Restore to Default**: Resets the grid to the default view settings

### 2. Status Bar with Current View Display

- **Location**: Bottom of the grid
- **Functionality**: Shows current view name and provides save functionality
- **Features**:
  - Displays current view name (clickable to open views list)
  - Shows "(Default)" indicator for default views
  - Save button to save current state to current view
  - Clicking view name opens the same views list as "Open View"

### 3. View Management Modals

#### Open View Modal
- Lists all available views with current view highlighted
- Shows "(Default)" indicator for default views
- One-click view switching
- Shows "Current View" indicator for active view

#### Save View Modal
- Simple input for new view name
- Validates view name (required, no duplicates)
- Captures current grid state (column order, filters, sorting, etc.)

#### Save View As Modal
- Similar to Save View but creates a new view instead of overwriting
- Useful for creating variations of current view

#### Manage Views Modal
- Lists all views with management options
- **Rename**: Inline editing of view names (disabled for default view)
- **Delete**: Remove views (disabled for default view)
- **Save**: Update current view with current grid state
- Visual indicators for default view protection

## Technical Implementation

### Components Updated/Created

1. **GridToolbar.tsx**
   - Replaced simple dropdown with comprehensive menu system
   - Added multiple modal dialogs for different operations
   - Integrated with all API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Added view management state handling

2. **GridStatusBar.tsx** (New)
   - Created new status bar component
   - Displays current view name with clickable functionality
   - Provides save button for current view
   - Integrates with view list modal

3. **BaseGrid.tsx**
   - Updated to pass new layout management props
   - Integrated with `restoreDefaultLayout` functionality
   - Enhanced prop passing to child components

4. **GridRenderer.tsx**
   - Updated to include status bar component
   - Adjusted grid height to accommodate status bar
   - Enhanced prop passing for view management

5. **useLayoutManager.ts**
   - Added `restoreDefaultLayout` function
   - Enhanced layout change handling
   - Improved error handling and state management

### API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/grid-layouts/:gridId` - Fetch all layouts for a grid
- `POST /api/grid-layouts/:gridId` - Create new layout
- `PUT /api/grid-layouts/:gridId/:layoutId` - Update existing layout
- `DELETE /api/grid-layouts/:gridId/:layoutId` - Delete layout
- `GET /api/grid-layouts/:gridId/default/ensure` - Ensure default layout exists

### Data Flow

1. **View Loading**:
   - Components fetch layouts on mount
   - Current view is determined by `currentLayoutId`
   - View names are displayed in dropdowns and status bar

2. **View Switching**:
   - User selects view from any interface
   - `handleLayoutChange` loads layout data
   - Grid state updated via `gridApi.setState()`
   - Current view updated in all components

3. **View Saving**:
   - User triggers save from toolbar or status bar
   - Current grid state captured via `gridApi.getState()`
   - Layout data saved to database
   - View list refreshed automatically

4. **View Management**:
   - Rename: Updates layout name in database
   - Delete: Removes layout (with default view protection)
   - Restore: Loads default layout and applies to grid

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Layout management was "buried" in the sidebar
- Required multiple clicks to access layout features
- No quick way to save current state
- No visual indication of current view
- Limited view management options

### After
- **Toolbar Access**: All view functions available in toolbar dropdown
- **Status Bar**: Current view always visible with quick save option
- **Multiple Entry Points**: Views accessible from toolbar and status bar
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of current view and default status
- **Comprehensive Management**: Full CRUD operations for views
- **Default Protection**: Default view cannot be deleted or renamed
- **One-Click Operations**: Quick switching and saving

## Usage Examples

### Switching Views
1. **From Toolbar**: Click "Views" → "Open View" → Select desired view
2. **From Status Bar**: Click on current view name → Select desired view
3. **Result**: Grid automatically updates to show selected view

### Saving Views
1. **Save Current**: Click "Views" → "Save View" (toolbar) or "Save View" button (status bar)
2. **Save As New**: Click "Views" → "Save View As" → Enter name → Save
3. **Result**: View is saved and automatically selected

### Managing Views
1. Click "Views" → "Manage Views"
2. **Rename**: Click "Rename" → Edit name → Click "Save"
3. **Delete**: Click "Delete" → Confirm deletion
4. **Result**: View list updated, current view adjusted if needed

### Restoring Default
1. Click "Views" → "Restore to Default"
2. **Result**: Grid resets to default view settings

## Configuration

The view management features are automatically enabled when:
- `gridId` is provided to the BaseGrid component
- User has access to layout data
- Layouts exist for the current grid

No additional configuration is required - the features appear automatically in both toolbar and status bar when conditions are met.

## Security Features

- **Default View Protection**: Default views cannot be deleted or renamed
- **User Isolation**: Views are isolated per user and grid
- **Validation**: View names are validated for uniqueness
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all operations

## Future Enhancements

- View sharing between users
- View templates for new grids
- View import/export functionality
- View categories or folders
- View search and filtering
- View comparison tools
- View history and versioning
